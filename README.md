# REGULAR EXPRESSIONS

daughertySingle.js

## OVERVIEW

- My bonus challenge on Regular Expressions did not go well, to say the least, because I had not learned about RegEx Methods.
- After the assessment session, I did my best to remember the challenge and, after I studied another course on Regular Expressions, began to work on it.
- - I had thought I'd mention this work in my interviews, were I lucky enough to advance after the assessment.
- - - I offer it now, if anyone is interested.

### IN THIS REPO

- My solution is in the file named: daughertySingle.js
- - I did not have this solution completed by the time I had my post-assessment interviews with Susan and Chris on January 27, 2021.
- - - I finished this up today, April 25, 2021.

- The other files are my steps in getting to my solution to the Regular Expressions challenge.
- - This is the work I had completed when I spoke with Susan and Chris, but our conversations were such that mentioning them would have been weird.
- - - This is in no way meant as a criticism of them or of me. We had great conversations which just didn't happen to include this topic.
